Gordon McDonald is a [Informatics Team Lead](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gdmcdonald/) at the [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://www.sydney.edu.au/sydney-informatics-hub), which is part of the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au). We consult in data science, visualisation and machine learning projects for academic researchers in all disciplines. Sometimes we work with external collaborators like government departments, hospitals and the police. Some days we're [automatically identifying australian native animals in camera traps](https://marsupial.ai/),  mapping [fish behaviour in a tank üêü](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/145571/3/rspb.2019.0448.pdf), [global mine waste üåè ‚õè](https://tailing.grida.no/) or [mercury levels](https://marine-studies-institute.sydney.edu.au/mercury-database/), other days I‚Äôm automating high pressure liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy üíâ to detect metabolites more efficiently, and some time in between I'm looking at [hospital](https://dhin.net.au/project-update-speed-extract/) [patient](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/8/1326/pdf) [data](https://adc.bmj.com/content/104/12/1150.abstract) üè• to get them better outcomes.

I completed my PhD in Physics with the [Atom Laser and Quantum Sensors group](http://atomlaser.anu.edu.au/) at the Australian National University. I used Bose-Einstein condensates to [build](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.013002) [new](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2143) [designs](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/16/7/073035) of [sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0268) known as [atom interferometers](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/152398/2/01_Hardman_Simultaneous_Precision_2016.pdf). These can be used to measure gravity (to find mineral and water üåä deposits, gravity waves üå†), inertial accelerations (guidance systems üõ∞, geology), magnetic üß≤ and electric fields ‚ö°Ô∏è, and fundamental physical constants (fine structure, big G ‚è± ). One day they will be inside all sorts of technology in everyday life.
