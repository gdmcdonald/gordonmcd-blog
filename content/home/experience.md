  description = """Working as a data scientist at the Sydney Informatics Hub, I have been applying frequentist, machine learning and Bayesian statistical techniques to a variety of research projects to produce insightful answers from structured and unstructured data. Highlights include:

**Health**

• An analysis of the relative risk of discharge against medical advice within the Sydney Children’s Hospital Network over five years of historical admissions records and 250k admissions, which I presented at the Health Data Analytics conference in Brisbane, October 2017.

• Clinical studies at the Woolcock Institute into sleep disorders such as insomnia and how they can be monitored with actigraphy measurements (i.e. a fitness wristwatch).

• Creating a software tool to streamline the process of analyzing metabolites through High Pressure Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (HPLC-MS) at the Charles Perkins Centre.

• Developing a software tool to enable researchers to calculate chemical concentrations and kinetics in complex biological reactions involved in cell differentiation in developing spinal cords.

**Education**

•Financial modelling for the NSW Department of Industry's Smart and Skilled program for Vocational education and training, a program which allocates more than $600 million a year in subsidies for NSW students.

**Social Science**

• Correlating election results for the 2016 US presidential election and the 2016 UK Brexit election with demographics of each electoral region.

• Analysing crime data across NSW looking for spatiotemporal patterns which can be exploited to improve policing efficiency.

While partly taking on the role of university statistician (2018-19) I provided statistical assistance to researchers across the university including meta-analyses, survey analysis and statistical methods.

I have taught customized 2 to 5 day courses in statistical data analysis and machine learning both in R and Python, delivered at the University of Sydney, UTS, Macquarie University and Amazon."""
