abstract = """We demonstrate a horizontal, linearly guided Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer in an optical waveguide. Intended as a proof-of-principle experiment, the interferometer utilizes a Bose-Einstein condensate in the magnetically insensitive |F=1,mF=0⟩ state of 87Rb as an acceleration-sensitive test mass. We achieve a modest sensitivity to acceleration of Δa=7×10−4 m/s2. Our fringe visibility is as high as 38% in this optically guided atom interferometer. We observe a time of flight in the waveguide of over 0.5 s, demonstrating the utility of our optical guide for future sensors."""
